Hi!

Itinerary is an app intended to help people with planning their trips, be them work, family or entertainment related.

This is the first prototype and it doesn't have all the functionalities or options intended.

As for now you can:
    *Create a new trip card with one of the categories: Swimming, Camping, City Break and Hikking.
    *Set start and end date for your trip.
    *Add footnotes
    *Select your desired location on a map
    
    *You can save your card trips, as well as delete them - the data is stored internally on the iPhone
    
Future options:
    >Share your trip with others
    >More categories
    >Adding Participants, who will be able to see the trip on their own devices
    >Adding friends
    >..
    
Things that can be improved right now:
    *There are no checks on the data entered by the users ( eg. users can enter an end date which is less than the start date )
    *Sometimes there's a glitch with the location selection map, where it doesn't save the location of the pin ( it has somethig to do with: .onEnded & .onChange methods )
    *Currently the app is written just for iOS 16, would be nice to cover older versions as well
    
PLEASE feel very free to give me feedback and comments, both on the idea and technical aspects :).

Happy Hacking!
